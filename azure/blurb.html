<p>&emsp; Xcalar is the first business analytics platform to enable Fundamental Discovery™ of meaningful insights directly from petabytes of data. Xcalar uniquely extends relational compute on a scale-out platform for modern data. It allows businesses to discover insights simply not possible otherwise. Xcalar’s unprecedented speed, scale, simplicity, and efficiency brings orders of magnitude reduction in the time needed to gain business insights regardless of the size and complexity of the dataset. Xcalar does not require any data prep or data shuffling before it begins analysis, nor does it need to move data due to its patent-pending True Data In Place™ technology. Xcalar delivers the fastest time-to-insight on the market.</p>

<p>&emsp; Xcalar is designed for general purpose processing and analytics. It supports the next generation of big data applications and Business Intelligence (BI) tools. Data cleansing, transformation, enrichment, and creation of algorithms and dataflows are achieved by iterating through the data model using Xcalar Design ­– a single intuitive GUI. Xcalar Design eliminates the use of complex and inefficient programming languages, such as HIVE, Pig, and Scala. Xcalar reduces time-to-value from months to hours while showing your entire data lineage.</p>

<p>&emsp; Data engineers and business analysts can carry out interactive data exploration on hundreds of billions of rows with ease and work on data cleansing, data quality and data preparation in a highly efficiently manner. Data scientists can then visually build data models, and export the result to existing databases, data warehouses, data marts, analytics applications, Tableau applications and other tools for visualization. The models can be operationalized to run on petabytes of raw data.</p>

<p>&emsp; Xcalar products run on-premises and on all major Cloud hosting services. Xcalar is storage agnostic and can use HDFS, Azure Storage, S3, GCS, or on-premises storage, such as SAN, NAS, and NFS.</p>

<p>&emsp; Xcalar is highly extensible through the Xcalar SDKs. Xcalar can also run Spark applications written in Scala, Java, and Python, and TensorFlow code written in Python.</p>

<p>&emsp; Xcalar tables are accessible through Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) standards, and work seamlessly with a variety of visualization and reporting tools, such as Tableau, Excel, Power BI, Looker, QlikView, and MicroStrategy.</p>
