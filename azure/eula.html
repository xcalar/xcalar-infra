<p><b>Xcalar End User License Agreement for Hosting Service Marketplaces</b></p>

<p>Please read this document carefully before proceeding. By clicking on the "I Accept" or "Agree" button or accessing or using the Xcalar software, you are agreeing to the terms of this end user license agreement ("<b>Agreement</b>"). </p>

<p>This is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or a single legal entity) ("<b>Customer</b>") and Xcalar, Inc., a Delaware corporation with offices at 3031 Tisch Way, Suite 420, San Jose, California 95128 ("<b>Xcalar</b>"). If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity (such as your employer), then you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that entity to this Agreement. As used herein, each of Xcalar and Customer may be referred to as a "<b>Party</b>" and collectively as the "<b>Parties</b>." </p>

<p>This Agreement governs your use of Xcalar's big data analysis and reporting software product (the "<b>Solution</b>") as made available by Xcalar through third-party marketplaces like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (each a "<b>Hosting Service</b>"). If Customer wishes to receive additional services, warranties, or other terms not provided by this Agreement, Customer must negotiate a separate written agreement with Xcalar regarding such terms. </p>

&emsp; <b>1.5 Reservation of Rights.</b> Except for the limited rights granted in Section 2.1, Xcalar retains all right, title and interest in and to the Licensed Software, and all intellectual property rights therein and thereto.
